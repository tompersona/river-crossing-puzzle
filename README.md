river-crossing-puzzle
   
The problem is a variation on the classic river crossing puzzle. In this
version, there are 8 people: a mother and father, 2 daughters, 2 sons, a
policeman and a thief.

The following rules apply:

   - only 2 people can be on the raft at a time

   - the father cannot stay with any of the daughters without their mother's
   presence

   - the mother cannot stay with any of the sons without their father's
   presence

   - the thief cannot stay with any family member if the policeman is not there

   - only the father, the mother and the policeman know how to operate the raft
